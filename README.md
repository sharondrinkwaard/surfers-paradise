# Introduction

Surfers Paradise, a surfschool located in Queensland, Australia. A warm climate, beautiful nature and the best waves.

Everyone who has ever wanted to try surfing, don't wait any longer! Take a look at this project and book your first surfing lesson. 

My goal for this project is to make it very easy for all users and visitors to make a booking for a surf lesson of choice. Being able to keep track of all bookings when logged in, update them if needed, or even to delete a booking.

Also that all necessary information is provided, like all contact information, what is included in a lesson and what times the lessons are everyday.

## Design
---

For the visual view of the web application, I used [WireFrame](https://mockflow.com) from Mockflow

## Planning
---
For planning this project I used a kanban board with user stories. Those are labeled with Must, Could or Should have. So it was easy to have an overview and keep track of how far the development was going.

When starting to set up the models.py, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram in Word.

## Testing
---

### Validators
- No errors returned when passing through the <strong>[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)</strong>.

- No errors returned when passing through the <strong>[CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)</strong>

- No errors but some warnings returned when passing through the <strong>[Python validator](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html)</strong>
As PEP8 Online is not available anymore (at least in my country) I chose this other python validator. 
The warnings it sometimes returned were not errors but simply the use of another style guide. I decided to stick to the PEP8, because I prefer this style and ignore the warnings.

- Below you can find the Lighthouse report.

### Manual Testing - Python & JavaScript

- I tested it the project displays well in Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

- I tested if all hovers work correctly. I confirm that they indeed do by hovering over all of them.

- I confirm that this design is responsive, functions well and looks good on all standard media devices, desktop, tablet and mobile phone. I tested this by using DevTools in the Chrome browser. 

- I confirm that there are no errors or bugs in the console while using DevTools in the browswer. I tested this by opening and refreshing the websiste several times while keeping DevTools open.

- I tested if all images are being displayed correctly from Cloudinary. Previously the images were not loading. Now they do and I confirm that they indeed are all being displayed. I tested this by loading every page several times to see if the images are being displayed. 

- I confirm that the messages/alerts (JavaScript)
 are working. I tested this by logging in and out several times. Each time a messages was being displayed at the top of the page. I also checked that the message would dissappear on it's own.
- I confirm that all user stories are implemented and are fullfilled. 

Below I placed my testing sheet where all tests I have done are mentioned and the results are being displayed.

## Bugs
---

### Solved bugs

  - When displaying the form on the booking page, the user could choose under which name to make a booking. So the form was displaying all the existing users in a dropdown option. Instead of just the authenticated user.
  I solved this by 
  ```
    current_user = request.user
    queryset = Booking.objects.filter(posted_by=current_user)
  ```
  - When displaying the form, I wanted to hide several model fields from the user. Those fiels were required so had to be filled in. I implemented this code by requesting the 'posted_by' field from the user and save the form afterwards.
  ```
   if form.is_valid():
      booking = form.save(commit=False)
      booking.posted_by = request.user
      booking.save()
      return redirect('overview')
  ```
  - When deploying to Heroku, all my images didn't load. I figured out this was because it is asking for another image.url than given. 
  In Cloudinary the style.css file is up to date, but when deploying to Heroku I would get an error about the collectstatic. I solved the error by linking my stylesheet with the direct Cloudinary url instead of a file path and then deploying with the config var: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1.

### Unsolved bugs

- When deploying to heroku, my css file doesn't load.
- A user can now still make bookings in the past.
- When the user is not logged in and tries to make a booking, an server error occurs. This is because the hidden forms cannot be generated if the user is not authenticated.
